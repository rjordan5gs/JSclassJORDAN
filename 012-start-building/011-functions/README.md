# Week 7

## Are you using DevTools?

- Yes, I am using devtools in order to have a more comprehensive understanding of what the code is actually doing. Although a bit confusing at first, I am getting used to using the console and source tabs.

## Does this Array Method make sense?

- I think the array method makes sense, its used to store data to be referenced to later
  or tracked by another part of the program. I'm sure there are other use cases for arrays
  but for the most part its used to store data.
