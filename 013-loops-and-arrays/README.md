## Week 7 Loops and Arrays

# Have you learned to use devtools and is it helpful?

- Devtools is definitly helpful in this use case since we are looping throught the function,
  it makes it easier to keep track of where things are stored on the array and whether or not
  your loop is actually looping.

# Does refactoring help your understanding of what is going on in the code?

- Refactoring seems like it can be a helpful way of making your code look better and
  helps keep track of whats going on in the program. It does actually help out my eyesight
  not having to squint at so much code, but it doesn't really help my understanding of what's
  the code is actually doing. That comes mostly from using devtools as stepping through the code
  helps me identify errors and how to fix them.

# How did you feel about this weeks lesson?

- As always Rio, I tend to learn alot about coding from your classes. Even though there are
  several concepts to go over, having me work through the code to figure out the problems has
  definitly forced me to learn how to identify problems and how to fix them. That being said, there
  is still alot I have to rinse and repeat. Arrays are something I am curious about and after this
  class I am definitly going to be researching more about them and what use cases they pertain to.
