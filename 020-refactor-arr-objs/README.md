## Week 9 README input

- CRUD Apps are just as you say in the example, a program that can create content, read said content, has the ability to delete said content, and update the content that users input. This can range from many applications such as twitter with its ability to create messages visible to the public and youtube with its ability to upload, display, edit and delete video content. I learned a little bit about these types of programs in my Java class, read to file, write to file, delete file, edit file.

- As far as making my own CRUD app, I was already thinking of making a note taking app, the functionalities we are currently working on would translate well into a to do list app or note taking app with things like journaling functionalities. As far as styling, minimalism seems to be in fasion and with a little css magic I think I could come up with something visually aesthetic.

- Concerning how I feel about writing a program on my own, I can say my confidence is just a little bit shaky being in the beginning of my CS path, but it is a challenge that I will eventually have to get through and I think with a little time I could come up with my own code for it.
