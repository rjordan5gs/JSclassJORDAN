# Week 10 README input

## Where in code do we start to render the table:

- We would render the data after the moment after the data was captured? We would need some data in order to put it on the table right?

## How would you create the tr and insert data in the row?

- I would imagine that you would use the collected data within each object and output into each container in the table. Honstly this one has me stumped!
