# Week 10 README input

## Where in code do we start to render the table:

- We would render the data after the moment after the data was captured? We would need some data in order to put it on the table right?

## How would you create the tr and insert data in the row?

- I would imagine that you would use the collected data within each object and output into each container in the table. Honstly this one has me stumped!

## How do we fix the rendering table issue at the end of the first assignment in Week 10?

In order for the issue to be solved, I would need to come up with code that tells the DOM to render only one table and keep it on the DOM in order to display the data.


## Did you understand the code?

I was wondering how TBL_OUTPUT.innerHTML = '' Solves the problem on the assignment question, does it just keep the table html generated so new data can enter it?

Also, why is it better to seperate these functions into two rather than one? Is this more about effeciency?
