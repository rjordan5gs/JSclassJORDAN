# Week 11 README input

This code looks a little more organized now that it is in module format, I'm sure it would come in handy breaking all this code into pieces based on funcitionality.

I keep running into an error about the storage, I ran some tests and it seems like whenever there is no tripdata in the local storage the program runs fine, but as soon as tripdata is set, it appears as undefined.

My guess is the JSON isn't being defined properly due to the parse.
