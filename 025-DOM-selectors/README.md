# Week 12 README input

## Fix my code
This is a confusing problem for me since each button is created after user input is accepted, I would have to code a way for each button after creation to have the same class and also disable them after an edit button is pushed using an event listener listening for a click on edit. I am not one hundered percent sure thats the only thing I will have to do, but its definitly on the right track.

## Which DOM selector and where would it go.
I would put the code in the render.js file under the function renderEditDelBtn and use the getelementbyclass name to group the edit buttons.



I WAS RIGHT! I had a rough idea what to do, just had to have the guidance!
