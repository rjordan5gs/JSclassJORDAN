# Week 13 README Intro to OOP

## What is the diffrence between how we've been creating objects and creating objects through class syntax?

At first glance, I think this will make it easier to make objects following the same format. It looks easier to manage and produce multipule objects of the same class using prototype inheritance. 

## Does the Student subclass make since? Do you now understand the protoype chain?

The prototype chain works with inheritance, several objects contains similar methods and functions from its parent object so it they can be used further down the chain. In a way they are all containers, but with the Student class I would say that it works the same as the blueprint it was given similar to a template.
