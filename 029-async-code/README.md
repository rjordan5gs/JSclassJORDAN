# Week 14 Async Code

## What is the callback for thing 1 and thing 2

For thing one the callback should be thing1 and thing2 according to the last part of the code and thing2 calls thing3.


## Coding challenge

I think I got most of the functions done, but for some reason I keep getting an error I've never seen before on the event listener on submit. I tried to implement the video knowledge into the code as well since async code confuses the heck out of me.
