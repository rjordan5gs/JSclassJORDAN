# Week 14 Promises

## Code Challenge:

I've made it so the startWorkout function returns a promise that resolves the setTimoutfunction post workout. I've also implimented a try catch block that awaits startWorkout to be resolved, but for some reason its asking for an async keyword?The catch keyword will console.log them.
