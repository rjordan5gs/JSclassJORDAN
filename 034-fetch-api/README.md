# Week 16 - Fetch API

## Do you run the program to troubleshoot problems?

Yes, usally everytime you troubleshoot problems through the browser inspector, I am right there running and refreshing everytime to see how the program runs step by step. On occasion, I turn in the assignment if the code looks like its going to work, But 9/10 I run the program to make sure I am getting the content of the assignment.
