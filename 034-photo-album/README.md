# Week 15 Code Challenge Photo Albumn

## My code

I created a getPictures function that returns a promise using .then() method after fetch. renderPictures passes the pictures as an argument and catches any errors using catch(). I also created a start function, because it worked in the video haha, but looking at your code async/await might have been the way to go.

Question: Are async/await and .then() similar or do they have specific use cases?
