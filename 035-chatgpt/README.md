## Questtions & Answers:

### What is the difference between let, const, and var in JavaScript? How do they affect variable scope and reassignment?

Certainly! The first question is about the difference between let, const, and var in JavaScript and how they affect variable scope and reassignment.

var: Variables declared with var have function scope. They are hoisted to the top of their scope and can be accessed before they are declared. They can also be reassigned and updated within their scope.

let: Variables declared with let have block scope. They are not hoisted, so they are only accessible after they are declared. They can be reassigned but not re-declared within their scope.

const: Variables declared with const also have block scope. Like let, they are not hoisted and are only accessible after they are declared. However, const variables are read-only and cannot be reassigned once a value is assigned to them. Note that this applies to the variable binding, not necessarily to the value itself. For objects and arrays, the properties or elements can still be mutated.


### What are closures in JavaScript, and how do they work? Can you provide an example to demonstrate their usage?

Certainly! The second question is about the concept of "hoisting" in JavaScript and how it affects variable and function declarations.

Hoisting is a JavaScript behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase, before the code is executed. This means that you can use variables and functions before they are actually declared in the code.

However, it's important to note that hoisting only moves the declarations, not the initializations or assignments. Variables declared with var are hoisted and initialized with a value of undefined, while functions are fully hoisted and can be called before their actual declaration in the code.


### How does asynchronous programming work in JavaScript, and what are the different techniques available to handle asynchronous operations?


Certainly! The third question is about JavaScript closures and their significance in programming.

A closure is a combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. It allows a function to access variables from its outer (enclosing) scope even after the outer function has finished executing. In other words, a closure allows a function to "remember" and maintain access to its lexical scope.

Closures are powerful because they enable data encapsulation and the creation of private variables. They allow you to create functions with persistent state and keep that state private within the function, preventing it from being accessed or modified by other parts of the code.


### What are the different ways to handle errors in JavaScript? How can you catch and handle exceptions effectively?

Certainly! The fourth question is about JavaScript prototypes and prototype-based inheritance.

In JavaScript, prototype is an object that is associated with every function and object by default. It allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects. Prototype-based inheritance is a way of creating objects where one object serves as the prototype for another object, allowing the second object to inherit properties and behavior from the first.


### How does JavaScript handle data types and type coercion? What are the key differences between primitive types and reference types?

Certainly! The fifth question is about JavaScript closures.

In JavaScript, a closure is a combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. It allows a function to access variables from its outer (enclosing) scope even after the outer function has finished executing. The closure "closes over" the variables, preserving them in memory.

## My Thoughts:

ChatGPT has been like an extension of my brain, I use it as a tutor, a calculator, and a translator for language and context. As my coding in its beginning stages, there's alot of jargon and vocabulary I am still unfamiliar with and with chatGPT around theres little barrier in the way for understanding and comprehension. I doubt that AI will progress to the point where we will be eliminating tech jobs, but I do think the productivity standards of tech will increase as chatGPT does. There is alot of scepticism when it comes to chatGPT, but I believe is it stimulates learning more than it is a all in one answer AI.
