## My Thoughts:

Using openAI's API was pretty simple considering our other assignements using API's, While I didn't get working code there I learned alot reading through the documentation. The API can convert javascript into python, create images and other forms of content, and parse unstructured data with ease. A database this big and diverse can have many applications in any field.
