# Week 10 Decision Making CRUD App

## My Decision Making:

My decision making process depends on the time of day, my happiness level, and how I am feeling. This is pretty detromental as my work ethic is completely based on my emotional responce, but I digress. The code goes as follows; If the time is greater than 8(pm) and I am happy, the decision will be diplayed to the DOM. My conditional staments are as folows; If I am having a good day and the time of day is less than 7 I am happy. Otherwise, if the time of day is past 8 and I am not having a good day, then I will question if I am happy today or not. If those thought conditions are not met I question wheter or not I am happy.

## Added Features 5/11:

I've added several features that will display to the DOM

1- userObj is used to store the record data and decision data logic.

2- addRecord Function; Allows the user to store they data in an array, (RECORDS[]), in order to use it later.

3- displayMessage Function; Takes in message argument as input and uses querySelector to select "message" in the HTML. Once      selected, it will set the text content to be displayed

4- added event listeners
